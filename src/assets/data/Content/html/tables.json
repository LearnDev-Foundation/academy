In some cases, you may need to use row headers instead of column headers. To create row headers, you can place <th> elements within a <th> element and use the scope attribute with the value \"row\".

You can use the same HTML elements and attributes to represent the footer content.

Each row contains one or more table cells (<td>) or table header cells (<th>). The number of cells in a row should match the number of columns defined in the table's header (<thead>) section.
